## Introduction

Node.js and Angular are identified as powerful tools for constructing robust, scalable, and efficient applications. By mastering these technologies, engineers will be equipped to create full-stack solutions. This workshop is designed for training engineers transitioning from other ecosystems, and will include foundational aspects of Angular and Node.js development. Engineers will learn to develop back-end projects utilizing native Node.js. Additionally, Angular's architecture, components, and data binding will be explored. Best practices for constructing scalable and maintainable applications will be addressed. The workshop format will combine theoretical explanations, hands-on exercises, and practical projects. A focus on bridging the gap between existing knowledge and the modern web development stack will be maintained.

## Workshop Objectives

Throughout this training, you will:

- Understand the core concepts of Node.js and its architecture
- Learn asynchronous programming and event-driven programming models
- Master Node.js's built-in modules and libraries
- Explore advanced topics such as database integration, testing, and deployment
- Understand Angular's architecture, components, and data binding

## Target Audience

This workshop has its inception in collaboration between an institution and a company, where a team of engineers needed adaptation. It is hence focused on their needs and assumes an engineering background. This might not be a good place to start one's learning.

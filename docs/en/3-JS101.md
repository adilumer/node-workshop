# Node.js Workshop - JS101

This section is a starter/refresher for JavaScript. For those actively developing in more strict environments like C/C++ or Java, some of the behavior of JS or the extent of its flexibility might come as a surprise. That flexibility can be both a friend and a foe, and requires one treads carefully in the bleak waters. The negative aspects of the flexibility JS provides can be avoided by following general clean code principles.

## Setup

Create a directory for your workspace to follow along with the coding examples. For this part, you can have your browser or Node.js interpret your code - your choice.

### Browser

Create a file and call it `index.html`. Add the following code to this file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JS Workshop</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Deneme SayfasÄ±</h1>
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the console window of your browser. Assuming a chromium based browser:

```sh
Mac
Command+Option+J

Windows/Linux:
Ctl+Shift+J
```

You will see the results of your work in browser console window. Open index.html in this browser. It would give some sort of error stating it couldn't find script.js, but lets not worry about that at this point. When asked to check the result, refresh your browser window and look at the console.

### Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed and your OS terminal is open, navigate to the directory you have ready to use as your workspace. You will see the results of your work in this window. When asked to check the result, enter `node ./script.js` in your terminal.

## Hello World

Now that we are ready, lets open our IDE and create a file named `script.js` in the same directory. Enter the following code in this file and save, then check the results.

```js
// This is my first script!
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This would print `Hello, World!` in your console. Congratulations! You have written your first JS script!

Assuming a non-null background in this field, lets summarize some of the aspects:

- **console.log()** is a built-in function that displays the output through stdout - the standard output stream in a computer program. So for the browser, its the browser console, and for Node.js it is the terminal it was invoked from. _Calling this function would be analogous to logging in this workshop here onwards._

- **console.log()** can take multiple arguments, separated by commas: `console.log("Hello",  "World", 1, 2, 3);`

- The semicolon is not a compulsion, interpreter can decide when an instruction has ended based on line breaks, but it is a best-practice for some edge cases where ambiguity is possible.

- **()** implies a function call, and function parameters are passed separated with commas; just like in Java or C#.

- Single-line comments are preceded by `//` and can be in-line.

- Multi-line or block comments are encapsulated by `/*` and `*/`.

```js
/*
This is 
a multiline 
comment
*/
```

## Variable definition

```var```, ```let```, and ```const``` are keywords used to declare variables. They have different scopes, hoisting behaviors, and mutability properties.

### var

- _var_ is function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside a function. It is not block-scoped.
- Variables declared with _var_ can be accessed within the function they are declared in or globally if declared outside any function.
- Variables declared with _var_ are hoisted to the top of their function scope but are initialized with undefined. This means you can reference the variable before its declaration without getting a _ReferenceError_.
- Variables declared with _var_ can be re-declared within the same scope without throwing an error.

### let

- _let_ is block-scoped. It is only accessible within the block (e.g., a pair of curly braces {}) where it is declared. This includes function blocks, loops, and if-else blocks.
- Variables declared with _let_ are also hoisted but are not initialized. Accessing them before their declaration results in a _ReferenceError_ due to the "temporal dead zone."
- Variables declared with _let_ cannot be re-declared within the same scope. This helps prevent accidental re-declaration and bugs.

### const

- _const_ is block-scoped, similar to let.
- Variables declared with _const_ are also hoisted but not initialized, resulting in a _ReferenceError_ if accessed before declaration.
- _const_ is used to declare variables that are constant and cannot be reassigned. However, this does not make the value itself immutable if the value is an object or array. The properties of objects and elements of arrays can still be modified.
- Variables declared with _const_ cannot be re-declared within the same scope.

## Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are actually declared in the code.

**Variable Hoisting:**

- var declarations are hoisted and initialized to undefined.
- let and const declarations are hoisted but not initialized, resulting in a _ReferenceError_ if accessed before declaration.

```javascript
var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10

{ 
// TDZ (temporal dead zone) starts here for variable 'b'
console.log(b); // _ReferenceError_: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 20;
console.log(b); // 20
}
```

**Function Hoisting:**

- Function declarations are hoisted and can be called before they appear in the code.
- Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way; only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the assignment.

```javascript
greet(); // "Hello, World!"

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

var sayHello;
console.log(sayHello); // undefined
sayHello(); // TypeError: sayHello is not a function

sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```

## Data types

Data types in a programming language define the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program. They specify the operations that can be performed on the data and the way the data is stored in memory. In JavaScript, primitive data types are the most basic types of data that are not objects and have no methods.

### Primitive data types

- **Number:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript uses a single Number type to represent all numbers, whether they are integers or floating-point values (e.g., 42, 3.14).

- **String:** Represents a sequence of characters used to represent text (e.g., "hello", 'world').

- **Boolean:** Represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.

- **Undefined:** A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value is of type undefined. _undefined_ is _falsy_.

- **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as a _falsy_ value (e.g., let x = null;).

- **Symbol:** Represents a unique and immutable identifier, often used to identify object properties uniquely (introduced in ECMAScript 6).

- **BigInt:** Represents whole numbers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (2^53 - 1). BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt constructor (introduced in ECMAScript 2020).

```javascript
// Number
let age = 30;
let price = 19.99;

// String
let firstName = "Alice";
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';

// Boolean
let isActive = true;
let hasFinished = false;

// Undefined
let undefinedVariable; // variable declared but not defined

// Null
let emptyValue = null;

// Symbol
let uniqueId = Symbol('id');

// BigInt
let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### Non-primitive data types

In addition to the primitive data types, JavaScript also has non-primitive (or reference) data types. These primarily include objects and functions, which are key to JavaScript's flexibility and power.

- **Object:** An object is a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are strings (or Symbols), and values can be of any type, including other objects. Objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
- **Array:** An array is a special type of object used to store ordered collections of data. Arrays can hold any type of data, including other arrays or objects.
- **Function:** Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions.
- **Date:** The Date object represents a single moment in time, stored as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
- **RegExp:** Regular expressions are used to match patterns in strings. They are objects in JavaScript created either via a constructor or literal syntax.
- **Map:** A Map object holds key-value pairs where the keys can be of any type.
- **Set:** A Set object lets you store unique values of any type.
- **WeakMap & WeakSet:** Similar to map and set, but values must be objects, and they are weakly referenced.

```javascript
// Object
let person = {
  firstName: "Alice",
  lastName: "Johnson",
  age: 30,
  isEmployed: true,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Wonderland"
  }
};

// Array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let mixedArray = [1, "hello", true, { key: "value" }];

// Function 
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
let greet = function(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
};

// Date
let now = new Date();
let specificDate = new Date('2024-08-06T12:00:00Z');

//RegExp
let pattern = /hello/;
let regex = new RegExp('hello');

//Map
let map = new Map();
map.set('name', 'Alice');
map.set(42, 'The Answer');

//Set
let set = new Set();
set.add(1);
set.add(5);
set.add(1); // duplicate value, will be ignored

//WeakMap
let weakMap = new WeakMap();
let obj = {};
weakMap.set(obj, 'value');

//WeakSet
let weakSet = new WeakSet();
let obj = {};
weakSet.add(obj);
```

### Some notes

Since JavaScript can smoothly work between datatypes without a hassle, all values have a representation in terms of other data types. For example, a string that cannot be converted to a number would come out as NaN, or not-a-number. It is especially useful with boolean operations since every value is either _truthy_ or _falsy_. When a truthy value is used in a conditional, it comes out as true; where as falsy values are interpreted as false:

```javascript
let x = 123; // A non-zero number is truthy
let y = ""; // An empty string is falsy

if (x){
  // this part will be executed
} else {
  // this part will be ignored
}

if (y){
  // this part will be ignored
} else {
  // this part will be executed
}
```

There are edge cases with floating points and very large numbers, that one has to be careful about. The _number_ data type is stored in 64-bit floating-point format (IEEE 754 standard). 9007199254740991 is hence the maximum value for a 'safe' integer:

```javascript
9007199254740992 === 9007199254740993; // is true !!!
```

## Operators

Operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations. There are different types of JavaScript operators:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Type Operators

A summary for each type is added below. You can use it as a reference when they are applied in upcoming chapters.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers.

| Operator | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| \*       | Multiplication               |
| \*\*     | Exponentiation (ES2016)      |
| /        | Division                     |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| ++       | Increment                    |
| --       | Decrement                    |

```javascript
let x = 0;
x++; //Post-increment, x is now 1
++x; //Pre-increment, x is now 2
x--; //Post-decrement, x is now 1
--x; //Pre-decrement, x is now 0
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

| Operator | Example   | Same As      |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| =        | x = y     |              |
| +=       | x += y    | x = x + y    |
| -=       | x -= y    | x = x - y    |
| \*=      | x \*= y   | x = x \* y   |
| /=       | x /= y    | x = x / y    |
| %=       | x %= y    | x = x % y    |
| \*\*=    | x \*\*= y | x = x \*\* y |

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

| Operator | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ==       | equal to (flexible, '3' == 3 is true)                   |
| ===      | equal value and equal type (strict, '3' === 3 is false) |
| !=       | not equal                                               |
| !==      | not equal value or not equal type                       |
| >        | greater than                                            |
| <        | less than                                               |
| >=       | greater than or equal to                                |
| <=       | less than or equal to                                   |
| ?        | ternary operator                                        |

```javascript
//ternary usage
const statement = Math.PI > 0 ? `Pi is positive` : `Pi is negative`;
console.log(statement); // Pi is positive
```

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| &&       | logical and |
| \| \|    | logical or  |
| !        | logical not |

### Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Description          | Example | Same as      | Result | Decimal |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
| &        | AND                  | 5 & 1   | 0101 & 0001  | 0001   | 1       |
| \|       | OR                   | 5 \| 1  | 0101 \| 0001 | 0101   | 5       |
| ~        | NOT                  | ~ 5     | ~0101        | 1010   | 10      |
| ^        | XOR                  | 5 ^ 1   | 0101 ^ 0001  | 0100   | 4       |
| <<       | left shift           | 5 << 1  | 0101 << 1    | 1010   | 10      |
| >>       | right shift          | 5 >> 1  | 0101 >> 1    | 0010   | 2       |
| >>>      | unsigned right shift | 5 >>> 1 | 0101 >>> 1   | 0010   | 2       |

### Type Operators

| Operator   | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| typeof     | Returns the type of a variable                             |
| instanceof | Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type |

## Math Object

The Math Object provides methods to work with numbers.

```javascript
const PI = Math.PI
console.log(PI)                            // 3.141592653589793
// Rounding to the closest number
// if above .5 up if less 0.5 down rounding
console.log(Math.round(PI))                // 3 to round values to the nearest number
console.log(Math.round(9.81))              // 10
console.log(Math.floor(PI))                // 3 rounding down
console.log(Math.ceil(PI))                 // 4 rounding up
console.log(Math.min(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // -5, returns the minimum value
console.log(Math.max(-5, 3, 20, 4, 5, 10)) // 20, returns the maximum value
const randNum = Math.random() // creates random number between 0 to 0.999999
console.log(randNum)
// Let us  create random number between 0 to 10
const num = Math.floor(Math.random () * 11) // creates random number between 0 and 10
console.log(num)
//Absolute value
console.log(Math.abs(-10))      // 10

//Square root
console.log(Math.sqrt(100))     // 10
console.log(Math.sqrt(2))       // 1.4142135623730951
// Power
console.log(Math.pow(3, 2))     // 9
console.log(Math.E)             // 2.718
// Logarithm
// Returns the natural logarithm with base E of x, Math.log(x)
console.log(Math.log(2))        // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.log(10))       // 2.302585092994046
// Returns the natural logarithm of 2 and 10 respectively
console.log(Math.LN2)           // 0.6931471805599453
console.log(Math.LN10)          // 2.302585092994046
// Trigonometry
Math.sin(0)
Math.sin(60)
Math.cos(0)
Math.cos(60)
```

## Strings

Strings in JavaScript are a sequence of characters used to represent text. They are one of the primitive data types in the language.

- They can be created using single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) for template literals. Strings are immutable.
- Once created, the contents of a string cannot be changed.
- Operations that modify a string will return a new string.
- Strings can be concatenated using the + operator or the concat() method.
- Introduced in ES6, template literals allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings using backticks.

```javascript
let singleQuoteString = 'Hello';
let doubleQuoteString = "World";
let templateLiteralString = `Hello, World!`;

let name = "Alice";
let greeting = `Hello, \"${name}\"!`;
let multiLine = `This is a
multi-line string.`;
const otherMultiline = "This is a\
multi-line string as well.";

// immutability
let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "h"; // No effect
console.log(str); // "Hello"

// concatenation
let greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World";
let greet = "Hello".concat(" ", "World");

// string utilities
let text = " Hello, World! ";
console.log(text.length); // 15
console.log(text.charAt(1)); // "H"
console.log(text.charCodeAt(1)); // 72 (H is ASCII 72)
console.log(text.includes("World")); // true
console.log(text.indexOf("World")); // 8
console.log(text.lastIndexOf("o")); // 9
console.log(text.search('ld')); // 11
console.log(text.slice(1, 6)); // "Hello"
console.log(text.toUpperCase()); // " HELLO, WORLD! "
console.log(text.toLowerCase()); // " hello, world! "
console.log(text.trim()); // "Hello, World!"
console.log(text.substring(1)); // "Hello, World!"
console.log(text.substring(2)); // "ello, World!"
console.log(text.substring(2, 4)); // "el"
console.log(text.split(' ')); // ['', 'Hello,', 'World']
console.log(text.includes('Hello')); // true
console.log(text.includes('hello')); // false
console.log(text.replace('World', 'Folks')); // ' Hello, Folks'
console.log(text.startsWith(' H')); // true
console.log(text.endsWith('ld')); // true
console.log(text.match('ld')); // ['ld', index: 11, input: ' Hello, World', groups: undefined]
console.log(text.match(/ld/gi)); // ['ld']
console.log(text.repeat(3)); // ' Hello, World Hello, World Hello, World'
```

## Casting & Type Checking

Casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. In JavaScript, this can be done either implicitly (automatically by the JavaScript engine) or explicitly (manually by the developer). It can be used to ensure type consistency, especially when handling user inputs or API responses.

### Implicit Casting

Implicit casting, also known as type coercion, happens automatically when JavaScript expects a specific type of value in a given context.

```javascript
// String to Number
let result = "5" - 2; // 3
let result = "5" * 2; // 10

//Number to String
let result = "5" + 2; // "52"
let result = 5 + "2"; // "52"

//Boolean to Number
let result = true + 1; // 2
let result = false + 1; // 1

//String to Boolean
if ("hello") {
  console.log("This is true"); // This will be logged
}
```

### Explicit Casting

Explicit casting is when you manually convert a value from one type to another using built-in functions or methods.

```javascript
//String to Number
let num = Number("123"); // 123
let num = parseInt("123"); // 123
let num = parseFloat("123.45"); // 123.45

//Number to String
let str = String(123); // "123"
let str = (123).toString(); // "123"

//Boolean to Number
let num = Number(true); // 1
let num = Number(false); // 0

//String to Boolean
let bool = Boolean("true"); // true
let bool = Boolean(""); // false

//Number to Boolean
let bool = Boolean(1); // true
let bool = Boolean(0); // false
```

## Dates in JS

Dates are handled using the ```Date``` object, which provides methods for creating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times. 
It provides various methods to retrieve or set specific components of a date.

```js

let specificDate = new Date(2024, 7, 6, 12, 30, 0); // Note: months are 0-indexed (0 = January, 11 = December)
console.log(specificDate); // 2024-08-06T06:30:00.000Z (in UTC)

let dateFromString = new Date("2024-08-06T12:30:00");
console.log(dateFromString); // 2024-08-06T12:30:00.000Z

let dateFromMillis = new Date(1672531200000); // Milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix Epoch)
console.log(dateFromMillis); // Date corresponding to the milliseconds

let now = new Date();
console.log(now); // Current date and time
// Getting date components
console.log(now.getFullYear()); // Year (e.g., 2024)
console.log(now.getMonth()); // Month (0-11)
console.log(now.getDate()); // Day of the month (1-31)
console.log(now.getHours()); // Hours (0-23)
console.log(now.getMinutes()); // Minutes (0-59)
console.log(now.getSeconds()); // Seconds (0-59)
console.log(now.getMilliseconds()); // Milliseconds (0-999)
console.log(now.getDay()); // Day of the week (0-6, 0 = Sunday)

// Setting date components
let date = new Date();
date.setFullYear(2025);
date.setMonth(11); // December (months are 0-indexed)
date.setDate(25);
date.setHours(10);
date.setMinutes(30);
date.setSeconds(0);
console.log(date); // Modified date

// Comparison
let date1 = new Date(2024, 7, 6);
let date2 = new Date(2025, 7, 6);
console.log(date1 < date2); // true
console.log(date1 > date2); // false
console.log(date1.getTime() === date2.getTime()); // false (comparing timestamps)

// Formatting
console.log(now.toDateString()); // "Tue Aug 06 2024"
console.log(now.toTimeString()); // "12:30:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)"
console.log(now.toISOString()); // "2024-08-06T12:30:00.000Z"
console.log(now.toLocaleDateString()); // Locale-specific date (e.g., "8/6/2024" in the US)
console.log(now.toLocaleTimeString()); // Locale-specific time (e.g., "12:30:00 PM" in the US)

const year = now.getFullYear() // return year
const month = now.getMonth() + 1 // return month(0 - 11)
const date = now.getDate() // return date (1 - 31)
const hours = now.getHours() // return number (0 - 23)
const minutes = now.getMinutes() // return number (0 -59)

console.log(`${date}.${month}.${year} ${hours}:${minutes}`) // 4.1.2020 0:56


// Timestamp to date and vice versa
let now = new Date();
let timestamp = now.getTime();
console.log(timestamp); // Milliseconds since January 1, 1970

let dateFromTimestamp = new Date();
dateFromTimestamp.setTime(timestamp);
console.log(dateFromTimestamp); // Date corresponding to the timestamp

//Parsing Dates
let millis = Date.parse("2024-08-06T12:30:00");
console.log(millis); // Milliseconds since January 1, 1970
let parsedDate = new Date(millis);
console.log(parsedDate); // Parsed date
```

JavaScript dates are internally represented as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 (the Unix Epoch). You can get and set this timestamp using ```getTime()``` and ```setTime()``` functions.

## Operator Precedence

Just like in other programming languages, operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence. When operators have the same precedence, their associativity (either left-to-right or right-to-left) determines the order of evaluation.

- Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.
- When operators have the same precedence, associativity (left-to-right or right-to-left) determines the order of evaluation.
- Parentheses can be used to explicitly control the evaluation order.

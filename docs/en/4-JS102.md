## Conditionals & Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code until a specified condition is met. Conditionals are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Conditionals and loops in JS are quite similar to Java & C#.

### The ```if``` conditional

The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```js
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
}
```

### The ```if...else``` conditional

if...else enables one of the two paths depending on whether specified condition is true or false.

```js
// syntax
if (condition) {
  //this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for falsy condition
}
```

### The ```if...else if..else``` conditional

This type of expressions enables working with multiple conditions, and sequentially follow if the previous condition(s) is/are false.

```js
if (condition1) {
  // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // Code to execute if condition3 is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
```

### The Switch Statement

Switch  is an alternative for ```if...else if...else```. It evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  // More cases...
  default:
    // Code to execute if no case matches
}
```

### Conditionals in action

Lets imagine we want to check whether today is a business day or weekend.

```js

let dayName, dayType;
let day = new Date().getDay(); // Get the numerical value for today

/* 
JS week starts from Sunday and ends on Saturday.
Lets reassign Sunday to 7 for easier operations. 
*/
if (day == 0) {
  day = 7;
}

// of course there are better ways to do this, but we are working on conditionals :)
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = "Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Invalid day";
}

if (day > 0 && day < 6){
  dayType = 'a business day.';
}else if (day >= 6 && day <= 7){
  dayType = 'weekend!';
}else{
  dayType = 'an invalid value for a day!';
}

console.log(`Today is ${dayName}, which is ${dayType}`);
```

Now I ran this code on a Tuesday, so the program output was:

```Today is Tuesday, which is a business day.```

### The ```for``` Loop

The for loop is generally used to execute a piece of code for a known number of times.

```js
/* Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to execute in each iteration
}
*/

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

### The ```for...in``` Loop

The for...in loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.

```js
/* Syntax:
for (variable in object) {
  // Code to execute for each property
}
*/

let person = { name: "Selda Bağcan", age: 75, city: "Muğla" };
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
// Output:
// name: Selda Bağcan
// age: 75
// city: Muğla
```

### The ```for...of``` Loop

The for...of loop iterates over iterable objects (like arrays, strings, maps, etc.).

```js
/* Syntax:
for (variable of iterable) {
  // Code to execute for each element
}
*/

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

### The ```while``` Loop

The while loop executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```js
/* Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // Code to execute as long as condition is true
}
*/

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```

### The ```do while``` Loop

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code once before checking the condition.

```js
/* Syntax:
do {
  // Code to execute
} while (condition);
*/

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

> Yes, you can entangle your JS engine in an infinite loop if the 'while' conditions are set to be never false: consider using while(i > -1) in the example above and see what happens. Be careful!

### Manipulating Loop Execution

#### Skipping an Iteration: continue

The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue; // Skip the iteration where i is 2
  }
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 3, 4
}

```

#### Breaking Out of a Loop: break

The break statement exits the loop immediately, terminating the loop entirely.

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break; // Exit the loop when i is 3
  }
  console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2
  i++;
}
```

#### Using continue and break in Nested Loops

In nested loops, continue and break affect the innermost loop in which they are used. You can also use labels to specify which loop to break out of or continue to.

```js
outerLoop: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (j === 1) {
      continue; // Continue the inner loop
    }
    if (i === 1) {
      break outerLoop; // Break the outer loop
    }
    console.log(`i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
  }
}
// Output: 
// i = 0, j = 0
// i = 0, j = 2
```

## Arrays

Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are a type of object and provide a variety of methods to perform different operations. They are similar to Arrays or lists in other programming languages you might be already familiar with.

### Creating Arrays and Manipulating Elements

The following examples would give you a quick start with arrays:

```js
const myFruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]; // You can create an array literally..
const yourFruits = new Array("Blueberry", "Watermelon", "Peach"); // or with a consutructor..
let hisFruits = []; // and even leave it emptuy at the start..
const someEmptyValues = Array(5) // or have some empty slots assigned from the start
console.log(someEmptyValues); // [empty x 5]

let myFirstFruit = myFruits[0]; // Apple is the first element in my fruits

yourFruits[2] = "Coconut"; // Your third fruit wan't a peach, was it a cocont?
```
